# Refactoring

- create autocomplete component
- use typescript & type all variables
- use enum instead of "magic number"
  - example:
  ```javascript
  name = "pillar" || "objectiveTemplateSlug" || "title";
  ```
- use file for international translation, don't use directly the label/string
- split too long functions, try to make complexity of 2
- use await or then, both are useless
- try to make the file lass than 300-400 lines
- maybe put the const Root code in a css file?
- it seems there are too much imports in one file
- this file seems even complexe with all these refacto, resulting of the wrong development since the beginning
- create an admin-grid component
